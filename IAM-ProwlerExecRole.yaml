Description: |
  This template creates an AWS IAM Role with an inline policy and two AWS managed policies
  attached. It sets the trust policy on that IAM Role to permit a named ARN in another AWS
  account to assume that role. The role name and the ARN of the trusted user can all be passed
  to the CloudFormation stack as parameters.
Parameters:
  AuthorizedARN:
    Description: "ARN of IAM Role which is authorized to assume the ProwlerExecRole role."
    Type: String

  ProwlerExecRoleName:
    Description: "Name of the IAM role that will have these policies attached. Default: ProwlerExecRole"
    Type: String
    Default: "ProwlerExecRole"
